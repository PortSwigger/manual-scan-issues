<p>This extension allows users to manually create custom issues within the Burp 
Scanner results.</p>
<p>Burp does a great job of finding issues, but it can't find everything. There 
are some tasks that must be completed by a user. With this extension, you can 
add an issue with all of the same properties as a native Burp issue. There are 
three tabs available:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The &quot;General&quot; tab contains all of the basic information about the issue: 
	the issue name, detail, background, remediation background, remediation 
	detail, url, port, confidence, severity, and protocol.</li>
	<li>The &quot;HTTP Request&quot; tab contains an editor that houses the HTTP request 
	of the custom issue.</li>
	<li>The &quot;HTTP Response&quot; tab contains an editor that houses the HTTP response 
	of the custom issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select the target that requires a custom issue.</li>
  <li>In the Contents or Issues section of the selected target, right click to
    show the context menu.</li>
	<li>From the context menu select &quot;Add Issue&quot;.</li>
	<li>Enter custom data into the relevant fields. The extension will auto-fill 
	the &quot;URL&quot; and &quot;Port&quot; data fields with the selected target's url and port.</li>
	<li>Once all of the data has been entered, click the &quot;Import Finding&quot; 
	button. </li>
	<li>&nbsp;A custom issue has been added to your target. </li>
</ol>
